A MicroApp to test iFrames and other links

Similar to the micro-app repository, this MicroApp is a little more fleshed out.  It is here to test some types of links and mainly the iFrame that is located in the detail panel.  This MicroApp does use routing and may be a good candidate if you are looking to build a MicroApp with routing.
